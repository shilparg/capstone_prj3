# capstone_prj3

Absolutely, Shilpa. Here's a **fully virtual, low-cost capstone** that simulates IoT, ML/AI, security, and DevOps workflows using AWS resources—**no physical hardware required**.

---

## 🌐 Capstone Title: “Virtual Smart Sensor Network with Predictive Analytics and Secure DevOps on AWS”

### 🎯 Objective
Simulate an IoT sensor network using synthetic data, stream it securely to AWS, apply ML/AI for anomaly detection, and enforce DevOps and governance best practices—all within Free Tier limits.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

| Layer | Function | AWS Services |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **IoT Simulation** | Generate synthetic sensor data (temp, humidity, vibration) | Python scripts, AWS Lambda |
| **Ingestion** | Secure streaming of virtual telemetry | AWS IoT Core, MQTT over TLS |
| **Processing** | Real-time + batch pipelines | AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Glue |
| **Storage** | Raw + processed data | Amazon S3, DynamoDB |
| **ML/AI** | Predictive modeling & anomaly detection | SageMaker (spot), Lambda + scikit-learn |
| **Security** | IAM, encryption, audit | IAM roles, KMS, CloudTrail, Config |
| **DevOps** | CI/CD, IaC, monitoring | CodePipeline, Terraform, CloudWatch |

---

## 🧪 IoT Simulation (No Hardware)

Use Python to simulate sensor behavior:

```python
import random, time
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

client = mqtt.Client()
client.tls_set()  # Secure TLS
client.connect("your-iot-endpoint.amazonaws.com", 8883)

while True:
    payload = {
        "temperature": round(random.uniform(20, 80), 2),
        "humidity": round(random.uniform(30, 90), 2),
        "vibration": round(random.uniform(0, 1), 2)
    }
    client.publish("iot/sensor/data", str(payload))
    time.sleep(5)
```

---

## 🧠 ML/AI Use Cases

- **Monitoring & Alerts**: CloudWatch metrics + SNS notifications

---

## 💰 Cost Optimization

Would you like help refining the synthetic data generator, drafting the README, or preparing the Terraform modules and ML notebook? We can also simulate fault injection and recovery for QA critique.

Awesome, Shilpa. Let’s build out the next set of deliverables for your **hardware-free, AWS-based capstone**. Here's what I’ll prepare now:

---

## ✅ 1. Synthetic IoT Data Generator (Python)

This script simulates temperature, humidity, and vibration data and publishes securely to AWS IoT Core using MQTT over TLS.

```python
import json, time, random
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import ssl

# AWS IoT Core endpoint and credentials
ENDPOINT = "your-iot-endpoint.amazonaws.com"
CLIENT_ID = "virtual_sensor_001"
TOPIC = "iot/sensor/data"

# TLS configuration
client = mqtt.Client(client_id=CLIENT_ID)
client.tls_set(ca_certs="AmazonRootCA1.pem",
               certfile="device-certificate.pem.crt",
               keyfile="private.pem.key",
               tls_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
client.connect(ENDPOINT, 8883)

# Simulate and publish data
while True:
    payload = {
        "temperature": round(random.uniform(20, 80), 2),
        "humidity": round(random.uniform(30, 90), 2),
        "vibration": round(random.uniform(0.0, 1.0), 2),
        "timestamp": time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    }
    client.publish(TOPIC, json.dumps(payload))
    print("Published:", payload)
    time.sleep(5)
```

You can run this from your laptop to simulate virtual sensors. Let me know if you want a version that runs as a Lambda function or container.

---

## 📘 2. README Section: Synthetic IoT Simulation

```markdown
### 🔹 Synthetic IoT Data Simulation

This module generates virtual sensor data (temperature, humidity, vibration) and publishes securely to AWS IoT Core using MQTT over TLS.

- No physical hardware required
- TLS-secured communication
- Configurable frequency and payload structure
- Compatible with downstream Lambda/Kinesis ingestion

Use this to simulate smart factory telemetry and test ML/AI pipelines, fault detection, and audit logging.
```

---

## 📊 3. Terraform Module: AWS IoT Core Setup

```hcl
resource "aws_iot_thing" "virtual_sensor" {
  name = "virtual_sensor_001"
}

resource "aws_iot_policy" "iot_policy" {
  name = "virtual_sensor_policy"
  policy = jsonencode({
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["iot:Connect", "iot:Publish", "iot:Receive", "iot:Subscribe"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iot_certificate" "cert" {
  active = true
}
```

Let me know if you'd like to add Lambda ingestion, CloudWatch logging, or SNS alerts next.

## 🧠 4. ML Notebook: Anomaly Detection + SHAP Explainability

Coming up next: I’ll prepare a notebook that trains a model on your synthetic data, flags anomalies, and uses SHAP to explain predictions—perfect for executive review and governance alignment.

---

Would you like me to bundle these into a GitHub-ready folder structure next, or help you annotate the architecture diagram for audit and DevOps maturity? We’re building something truly portfolio-worthy here.

Brilliant, Shilpa. Here's how we’ll package your **hardware-free AWS capstone** into a clean, modular GitHub-ready structure—perfect for executive review, recruiter impact, and portfolio presentation.
